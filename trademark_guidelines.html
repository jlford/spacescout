        <h2>SPACESCOUT&trade; TRADEMARK GUIDELINES</h2>
        <p>This page contains the official guidelines for use of the SpaceScout Trademarks.</p>
        
        <p>The SpaceScout trademark and the SpaceScout design logo, either separately or in combination, are hereinafter referred to as &#8220;SpaceScout Trademarks&#8221; and are trademarks of the University of Washington (&#8220;UW&#8221;). Except as provided in these guidelines, you may not use the SpaceScout Trademarks or any confusingly similar mark as a trademark for your product or service, or use the SpaceScout Trademarks in any other manner that might cause confusion in the marketplace. UW protects the SpaceScout Trademarks on behalf of the SpaceScout Project. Trademark law obligates trademark owners to police their marks and prevent the use of confusingly similar names by third parties.</p>
         
        <p>UW may grant permission for uses as outlined below. </p>

        <p>Except as set forth herein, UW retains and reserves all rights to the SpaceScout Trademarks and their use, including the right to modify these guidelines.</p>

        <p>These guidelines may be amended from time to time at UW’s discretion.</p>


        <h3>What are the SpaceScout Trademarks?</h3>

        <p>The SpaceScout Trademarks are the intellectual property of UW and may only be used by authorized licensees with express written permission. UW may license use of the SpaceScout Trademarks to educational institutions for noncommercial purposes. To request to license the use of the SpaceScout Trademarks please fill out the license agreement at <a href="http://uw-it-aca.github.io/spacescout/licensing" title="SpaceScout licensing">http://uw-it-aca.github.io/spacescout/licensing</a>.</p>

        <p>In text, the first and/or most prominent use of the wordmark SpaceScout should appear as:</p>
        
        <p class="indent">SpaceScout&trade;</p>
        
        <p>Note that the SpaceScout is one word with the second &#8220;S&#8221; capitalized.</p>

        <p>The logos look like:</p>
        <div class="images">
            <img src="images/icon_only.png" alt="SpaceScout icon logo"/>
            <img src="images/icon_and_text.png" alt="SpaceScout text and icon logo"/>
        </div>

        <p>The 'TM' trademark symbol must always be visible and readable for the logos in the placements shown in these guidelines. You may not remove or obfuscate the TM symbols in the logos.</p>
        <p>Do NOT change the font, colors, or proportions (such as by stretching or distorting) of the logos in any manner. Approved licensees will be provided with electronic versions of the logos.</p>
        
        <h4>Licensed users may use the SpaceScout Trademarks in two ways:</h4>
        <p>Licensees may use the SpaceScout Trademarks to promote that their products or services are based on the SpaceScout Project software code. In such cases, the phrase &#8220;powered by&#8221; is to be used in conjunction with any use of the SpaceScout Trademarks. For example:</p>
    	
    	<p class="indent">Acme Service <em>powered by</em> SpaceScout&trade;.</p>
       
       <p>Alternatively, the SpaceScout Trademarks can be used in conjunction with the name of the educational institution deploying the SpaceScout Project code.   For example:</p>
        
       <p class="indent">SpaceScout&trade; at Acme University</p>
	
	    <div class="images">
            <img src="images/icon_text_atInstitution.png" alt="Spacescout at your institution logo"/>
        </div>
        
        <p>In either case, you must make clear that the marks are used under license, and that the product and service are not a joint venture between the institution and UW.</p>
        
        <h3>Proper Trademark Usage</h3>
        
        <p>The trademark symbol must be in the first and most prominent appearance of SpaceScout Trademarks but does not need to be used in every location (especially in text).</p>

        <p>Use of the SpaceScout Trademarks must be accompanied by an acknowledgment that the University of Washington owns the trademarks. The acknowledgment should appear as a footnote, at the bottom of a webpage or at the end of a printed document. The statement is: &#8220;The &#8220;SPACESCOUT&#8221; trademark and the &#8220;SPACESCOUT&#8221; design logos are trademarks of the University of Washington and are used with permission.&#8221; A link to the SpaceScout Project webpage at <a href="http://uw-it-aca.github.io/spacescout/" title="SpaceScout webpages">http://uw-it-aca.github.io/spacescout/</a> should be included as well.</p>
        
        <p>Never use terminology that states or implies that the SpaceScout Project assumes any responsibility for the performance of your products and services.</p>

        <p>Never use a trademark as a verb. Trademarks are products or services, never actions. Never pluralize a trademark. Never use &#8220;a&#8221; or &#8220;the&#8221; to refer to an instance of the trademark. Always use a trademark as an adjective modifying a noun, or as a singular noun.</p>
