        <h2>What is SpaceScout™?</h2>
        <p>SpaceScout is an application designed to help students at the University of Washington find campus study spaces that meet specific criteria. It is currently available as a native iOS application from the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spacescout/id551472160?ls=1&mt=8">iTunes store</a>  and as a mobile-optimized web application that can be accessed from any desktop computer or mobile device at <a href="http://spacescout.uw.edu/">SpaceScout.uw.edu</a>. The app is a response to feedback from students about the difficulty of finding available study spaces that meet their needs.</p>

        <p>The app currently includes over 200 spaces on the UW-Seattle campus and 70 spaces at UW-Tacoma. With building renovations, remodels, and upgrades continually changing the landscape of learning resources on campus, SpaceScout provides a single place to go for up-to-date information on spaces that can help students accomplish their work.</p>

        <p>SpaceScout was developed by UW Information Technology in collaboration with UW Libraries, Housing and Food Services, and UW Computing Directors, and funded in part by the Student Technology Fee Committee. SpaceScout was released to UW Seattle as a native iOS application in August 2012, and as a web application designed for use on desktop computers or mobile devices in October 2012. UW Tacoma spaces were added in June 2013, and UW Bothell spaces will be added in the 2013-2014 school year.</p>
